Short Name: evil7:dismal solace

[Description]
Quake 3: Arena texture set in a gothic/metal theme.

[instructions for Q3Radient/GTKRadient users]

basic usage:
Place the 'e7' folder inside your "baseq3/textures' folder
Place the e7.shader in your /scripts folder
Add e7 to your shaderlist.txt file to see them in Q3Radient/GTKRadient

suggested usage:
I'd encourage you to make your own directories for my textures for your map like so ... 

"baseq3/textures/mymapname/" (place my textures here.)

"baseq3/scripts/mymapname.shader" (add my shaders here, making sure to edit the paths in the original shader file.)

[Thanks]
Everyone who had kind words to say about my other sets and
the people at the Quake3World.com Level Editing Forum.

Everyone who has used/will use my textures in their maps.
This is why I make them. :)


[Stuff]
If you use any of the textures it would be cool if you emailed me with the url to some screenshots if possible. 
I really would like to see what uses mappers have made of them.

Listed below are the various source material websites I used for creating my "mm-textures" for the SAUERBRATEN engine/game.

All sources I used claimed the textures are free to use for non-commercial use. Each website has there own way of wording it, so if your interested, visit their sites.

None of the textures were "just copied and renamed". All were modified / layered / enhanced / pieced together by me.

Feel free to use my "mm-textures" any way you want, just please give me credit in your readme file.

Enjoy!
